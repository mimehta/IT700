<h4>A predictive model of the Medical charges.</h4>
<p>Regression analysis is used to build the model for prediction of the medical charges(Outcome) based on the relation with the independent variables. The predictive model is built based on the analysis that shows the significant relation with age, smoking habit, and BMI of the patients. The Multiple linear regression derives the coefficients that specify the magnitude of the relation of the variable and outcome.</p>
<p> formula: Charges = <strong> B0 + B1(age) + B2(smoker) + B3(BMI) </strong>: B0, B1, B2 and B3 are the coefficients and specify the change in the outcome for the unit change in the variable.</p>

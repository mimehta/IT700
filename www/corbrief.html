<h4>Correlation with charges</h4>
<p> Primary objective is to find the correlation of the attributes with the Medical cost.</p>
<p> The correlation matrix is a graphical representation that highlights the association between the attributes and value of the correlation coefficient is represented by the size of the square and intensity of the color. The blue color represents the positive correlation coefficient and orange represents the negative coefficient, the darker shade and bigger size of the square represent the high correlation coefficient. </p>
<p> The correlation table is a shows the actual value of the correlation coefficient of the attributes with the medical charges.</p>
